<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a U.S. Navy veteran of 7 years. After being gifted the oppourtunity to explore various locations within the country and 7 different countries around the world, I was brought to Colorado where I was led to end my career and settle (for now). Soon after offically leaving the Navy, I emabrked to Cambodia for a mission trip; something I felt a deep calling for. As banal as it sounds, it truly was a life changing experience. Coming back to the States, I became a Sunday school teacher, beginner adult Korean teacher (long story) and a full time student. The best summer of my life follwed by one of the worst seasons of life quickly after. Mainly because of school. </p>

<p>I've always been somewhat of a nerd when it came to technology. Computers, games, cellphones, etc. I've recently begun the journey of programming which has been fun. Building my computer and getting my SEC+ cert has been some of my proudest achievements; ones I hope I can utilize in a career soon. Other than that, I am big into fitness, art, language learning and spending time with my friends. I am around an intermediate level Korean speaker with the hopes of achieving fluency someday. </p>

<p>I grew up in Arkansas, about an hour away from Memphis Tennessee with my three younger sisters. I had a fun upbrining, but the nature of the small town I grew up in didn't provide much excitment pre-Navy. Post-Navy is looking to be even more fulfilling.</p>
